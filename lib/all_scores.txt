Tawse, Cabernet Franc, 2008. Excellent. Bought at restaurant. $72. 92/100. [1 Apr 2011].
Tawse, Sketches Of Niagara, Chardonnay, 2009, VQA Niagara Peninsula, LCBO# 89037. Miwa really really liked it. I thought it was good, but just a little too sour (that Niagara sourness and distinctive flavour) to be great. $19.95. 87/100. [26 Feb 2012].
Tawse, Meritage, Cabernet Sauvingon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, 2006. A good wine, but for this price I expect a lot more. $48. 92/100. [1 Jan 2009].
Tawse, Riesling, 2007. Tasted like weak apple juice, just a little less sweet. Not good at all. $25. 70/100. [1 Jan 2009].

13th Street, Gamay, Niagara Peninsula, 2008. Nice. Has that distinctive Ontario minerality, which works in this case. $17.95. 91/100. [5 Mar 2011].
13th Street, Old Vines, Riesling, 2009. RRR. Bought at winery. $23.95. ?/100. In fridge. To 2020.
13th Street, Viognier, 2011. No bad. Bought at winery. $19.95. 86/100. [9 Oct 2012].
13th Street, White Palate, Niagara Peninsula, Chardonnay Musque, Gewurztraminer, Riesling, Chardonnay, Semillon, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, 2009. A nice balance. Not as much vibrance as other 2009 Ontario whites but a nice sophistication. $14.95. 91/100. [25 Jan 2011].
13th Street, White Palette, 2010, White Blend, VQA Niagara Peninsula, LCBO# 207340. Nice fruity flavour. $14.95. 91/100. [6 Dec 2011].

Tinhorn Creek, BC, Cabernet Franc, 2007. For the price, inelegant. Not bad, but not a good bargain for the price. $19.95. 84/100. [1 Aug 2010].

Travigne, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, 2007. Not a good wine by any stretch, but drinkable at this price. $7.99. 87/100 [3 Nov 2009].
Trius, Cabernet Franc, 2009. Weak. Discounted by $2. $12.95. 84/100. [30 Apr 2011].
Trius, Cabernet Franc, 2010. Nice at the winery. Not quite as good later. $14.95. 84/100. [12 Oct 2011].
Trius, Chardonnay, 2008. Meh. Not a lot of flavour or character. $13.25. 84/100. [19 Oct 2009].
Trius, Dry Riesling, 2008. Sour, not very good flavour. $12.95. 65/100. [26 Nov 2010]. Not much better, but it didn't offend me as much as before. Discounted by $2. $10.95. 79/100. [15 Jun 2011].
Trius, Merlot, 2009. A little sour at first, then okay. Nothing special. $12.95. 84/100. [22 Sep 2011].

Union, White, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Chardonnay, Gewurztraminer, 2010, LCBO# 197145. A little too much like sour apple juice; as it warmed the flavour got more complex but it was never very good. $13.95. 84/100. [2 Aug 2011].

Vineland Estates, Cabernet Franc, 2007. A bit sour, but a nice light fruity taste, from the vintage year of 2007. Nice flavour. $17. 92/100. [1 Jan 2009].

Vineland Estates, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, 2005. This shares the same Niagara peninsula flavour that a lot of the wines of the area have. But the flavour is a bit weak, and definitely not nearly worth the price. $40. 91/100. [1 Jan 2009].
Vineland Estates, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, 2008. Definitely a Canadian Cab Merlot. But pretty good. Bought at winery. $15.00. 87/100. [3 Oct 2010].
Vineland Estates, Chardonnay, 2008. Quite nice. Pretty good. Sweetish. $12.95. 91/100 [6 Jul 2010].
Vineland Estates, Chardonnay, 2009. Really nice flavour. Bought at winery. $12.75. 91/100. [27 Oct 2010].
Vineland Estates, Elevation Cabernet, 2007. A nice wine, but too boozy for a higher score, even after decanting. $25. 92/100. [1 Jan 2009]. A little overshadowed by one of Logan's 2003 South Africans; nevertheless it was great. $25. 92/100 [30 Jun 2010].
Vineland Estates, Reserve, Meritage, 2007, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot. RRR. Gift from Logan. $85. In fridge. To 2017.
Vineland Estates, Chenin Blanc, 2011. At first pretty sour. Then a nice clean sweet-sour. But it ended with a nasty sourness, kind of like puke. Bought at winery. $16.75. 84/100. [22 Oct 2012].
Vineland Estates, Pinot Meunier, 2008. A quite nice light red. Bought at winery. $15. 91/100. [7 Oct 2010].

Vineland Estates, Riesling, St Urban, 2011. Great texture, like micro-bubbles. The flavour had a little too much apple juice. Bought at winery. $19.75. 89/100. [23 Nov 2012].
Vineland Estates, Sauvignon Blanc, 2007. Fruity but very flavourful. A great wine. $14.95. 91/100. [5 March 2010]. Still excellent the second time. $16.95. 91/100. [3 Apr 2010]. Why does the price keep going up? Still great though. $17.95. 91/100. [6 May 2010].
Vineland Estates, Semi-Dry, Riesling, 2008. First sip was way too sour. Later sips were much better, although still with a lot of sourness. I don't care for sourness, but overall it was okay. $13.95. 87/100. [19 May 2010].
Vineland Estates, Riesling, Semi Dry, 2009, VQA Niagara Peninsula, LCBO# 232033. Kind of sweet. Might have been alright without the sweetness. $13.95. 84/100. [18 Dec 2011]. I really should read the old reviews. Once again, I found the sweetness unattractive with a main course. Nice sparkly texture. It would have been better as an aperitif. $13.95. 86/100. [27 Aug 2012].
Vineland Estates, Syrah, 2004. Very peppery. The flavour was quite different from when we thought it was worth $40 at the winery. That could be because of the conditions in our Bathurst condo's "wine rack". $40. 91/100. [Feb 21 2009].

Viewpointe, Cabernet Franc, 2007,  VQA Lake Erie North Shore, LCBO# 220715. Tremendous. $12.95. 92/100. [3 Jun 2012]. Still great. $12.95. 92/100. [15 Jun 2012]. Excellent. $12.95. 92/100.

Chile
Anakena Lilén, Single Vineyard, Viognier, 2010, Requínoa, Rapel Valley, LCBO# 45138. Very nice. Miwa liked it especially. $13.95. 91/100. [15 Dec 2011].

Concha Y Toro, Trio Reserva, White Blend, 2009, Casablanca Valley, LCBO# 433938. Pretty good, but a little on the sweetish side. Second bottle of the night. $12.95. 84/100. [15 Sep 2011].
Concha Y Toro, Casillero del Diablo, Syrah, 2007. I bought it because it came in a fancy box, supposedly a really good vintage. We'll find out. Very hearty, a beautifully deep colour, and a pretty nice taste. Nothing earth-shattering but a nice value. $12.95. 91/100. [1 Jan 2009]. Tried it again, just as good. 91/100. [2 June 2009].
Concha Y Toro, Maycas Del Limari Reserva, Syrah, 2009, Limari Valley. Probably should have let it age longer, but it was really raw and loaded with tannins. $14.95. 79/100. [1 Jan 2009].

Emiliana, Winemaker's Selection, Estate Vineyard, Carmenere, 2009, Los Robles, Colchagua Valley, LCBO# 256651. Good; but after we've had some much nice wine recently it's a little lacking. $19.95. 87/100. [29 Jan 2012].

Errazuriz, Carmenere, 2008. Very robust. Dark and inky, but it mellowed slightly (nicely) in a decanter. $13.95. 91/100. [1 Jan 2009].
Errazuriz, Sauvignon Blanc, 2008. "Bright acidity", said the bottle. That's a good description. A very nice wine. Great flavour. $14.95. 92/100. [12 March 2009].

Montes, Classic Series, Cabernet Sauvignon, 2009, Colchagua Valley, LCBO# 157883. Hot and boozy. Immature. $11.90. 85/100. [11 Oct 2012].

Montes, Limited Selection, Pinot Noir, 2009, Casablanca Valley, LCBO# 37937. Crap. Tasted like 70% cheap merlot. $14.95. 75/100. [12 Jan 2012].
Montes, Alpha, Syrah, 2006. Strong boozy aroma out of the bottle. Robust. Pretty good, but it never really wowed me. $22.95. 91/100. [1 Jan 2009].

Santa Alicia, Merlot, 2008. Pretty good, but definitely not the same quality as the carmenere. $11.95. 86/100. [24 Aug 2009]

Château Beaucastel, Chateauneuf-du-Pape, Mourvedre, Grenache, Counoise, Syrah, Cinsault, 2006. When I opened it, at first it was so strong I thought it had turned to vinegar. I decanted it for an hour. It was simply amazing - not just 2.6 points out of ten better than most wine I drink, but hundreds of times better. Very robust, and perfect with the beef short ribs and tenderloin that we had for dinner. $89.95. Wedding Gift. 96/100. [6 Mar 2010].

Chateau Ducla Superior, Bordeaux, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, 2005. A nice colour and flavour. A pretty good value, although for a supposedly amazing vintage, it doesn't live up to the hype. $15. 91/100. [1 Jan 2009].

Chateau Lafon, Cuvée Classic, 2006, Ac Listrac, Bordeaux, LCBO# 165399, Red Blend. Excellent value. $16.95. 92/100. [2 Dec 2011]. Just not good the second time around. Strange. $16.95. 84/100. [2 Jan 2012].

Chateau La Couronne Mahler-Besse, Bordeaux, Red Blend, 2005. Nice, but for some reason not a lot of flavour. $29.95. 87/100. [1 Oct 2010].
